# FFMPEG_Scripts

A collection of various useful scripts I've written.

ffmpeg is an extremely useful tool for maniplating and converting audio and
video files, it can become quite annoying to remember all the flags and syntax
needed. Also, ffmpeg only works on one file at a time, so for batch processing,
scripts are quite useful.
